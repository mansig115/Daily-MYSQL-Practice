A CTE, short for Common Table Expression, is like a query within a query. With the WITH statement, you can create temporary tables to store results, 
making complex queries more readable and maintainable.
These temporary tables exist only for the duration of the main query, streamlining your analysis process.

Q- Write a query to rank the artists within each genre based on their revenue per member and extract the top revenue-generating artist from each genre. 
Display the output of the artist name, genre, concert revenue, number of members, and revenue per band member, sorted by the highest revenue per member within each genre.

WITH ranked_concerts_cte AS (
  SELECT
    artist_name,
    concert_revenue,
    genre,
    number_of_members,
    concert_revenue / number_of_members AS revenue_per_member,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY genre
      ORDER BY concert_revenue / number_of_members DESC) AS ranked_concerts
  FROM concerts
)

SELECT
  artist_name,
  concert_revenue,
  genre,
  number_of_members,
  revenue_per_member
FROM ranked_concerts_cte
WHERE ranked_concerts = 1
ORDER BY revenue_per_member DESC;
